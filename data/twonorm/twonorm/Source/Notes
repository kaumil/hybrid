This is an implementation of Leo Breiman's twonorm
example[1]. It is a 20 dimensional, 2 class classification
example. Each class is drawn from a multivariate normal
distribution with unit variance. Class 1 has mean (a,a,..a)
while Class 2 has mean (-a,-a,..-a). Where a =
2/sqrt(20). Breiman reports the theoretical expected
misclassification rate as 2.3%.
